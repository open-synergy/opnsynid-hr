  First of all, Employee Sign's In.
-
  !record {model: hr.attendance, id: hr_attendance_0}:
    employee_id: hr.employee_al
    name: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 08:00:00')
    action: 'sign_in'
-
  After two hours, Employee Sign's Out.
-
  !record {model: hr.attendance, id: hr_attendance_1}:
    employee_id: hr.employee_al
    name: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 12:15:00')
    action: 'sign_out'
-
  I check the attendance data.
-
   !python {model: hr.attendance}: |
     att_0 = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('hr_attendance_0'), context=context)
     assert att_0.duration == 4.25, "Attendance duration must be 4:15, but it's %s" % att_0.duration
